### <strong>Project summary</strong>
<p>Cara e-commerce was born as a prototype practice of the MERN stack. It uses the structure of MVC folders and components to achieve an optimal division of tasks and generate reusable code.</p>
<p>The goal of this project has been solved effectively. Although, there are missing practices such as LocalStorage implementation, or an improvement in the use of JWT. The project fulfills its function as a prototype and main objective.</p>
